# FluxMedia

> FluxMedia is a provider-agnostic media upload library for JavaScript and TypeScript. Upload images, videos, and files to Cloudinary, AWS S3, or Cloudflare R2 using a single unified API. Write your upload logic once, switch providers without changing a single line of code.

FluxMedia is an open-source library — not a storage service. It wraps existing cloud storage providers behind a consistent interface. The project is organized as a monorepo of npm packages under the `@fluxmedia` scope.

Key capabilities:
- Unified API across all providers: `upload`, `delete`, `get`, `getUrl`, `uploadMultiple`, `deleteMultiple`
- Plugin system with lifecycle hooks: `beforeUpload`, `afterUpload`, `onError`, `beforeDelete`, `afterDelete`
- React hooks (`useMediaUpload`) and components (`MediaUpload`) for client-side uploads
- File type detection using magic bytes (more reliable than file extensions)
- Official plugins: file validation, image optimization, metadata extraction, analytics, retry with exponential backoff
