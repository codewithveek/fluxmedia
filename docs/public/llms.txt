# FluxMedia Documentation

> FluxMedia is a provider-agnostic media upload library for JavaScript and TypeScript. It provides a unified API for uploading images, videos, and files to any cloud storage provider including Cloudinary, AWS S3, and Cloudflare R2. Write your upload logic once, switch providers without changing code.

FluxMedia is available as a set of npm packages under the `@fluxmedia` scope. The core package provides the `MediaUploader` class and plugin system, while provider packages implement the `MediaProvider` interface for specific services. A React integration package provides hooks and components for client-side uploads.

- FluxMedia is *not* a storage service — it is a library that wraps existing providers
- All providers share the same API surface: `upload`, `delete`, `get`, `getUrl`, `uploadMultiple`, `deleteMultiple`
- Plugins extend behavior via lifecycle hooks: `beforeUpload`, `afterUpload`, `onError`, `beforeDelete`, `afterDelete`
